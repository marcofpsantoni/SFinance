# SFinance
Standalone code from PyCharm

SFinance is a class of simple Standalone algorithms for Finance in Python 3.6 & 3.7.
Many ideas, maths, models and methods are taken, improved or modified from the following books:

• Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives, J. C. Hull

• A Man for All Markets, E. O. Thorp

• Counterparty Credit Risk, J. Gregory

• Stochastic calculus for finance I, II, S. E. Shreve

• Problems and Solutions in Mathematical Finance, E. Chin, D. Nel and S. Ólafsson

• Python for Finance, Y. J. Hilpisch

• Modeling Derivatives in C++, J. London

The code is created in PyCharm and can be tested on Jupyter Notebook with minor changes: 
(e.g. you simply add the line %matplotlib inline)
